# Adventures with pinephone

Greetings! This is a git repository documenting the adventures being had with the pinephone.

Documentation will be sorted out by OS most likely. It's a work in progress as more stuff is being placed on the phone. Certain things are general enough that they won't be organized by this method and will probably be dumped into the "general" folder.

## My phone specs

The pinephone is a postmarketOS community edition, containing 3GB memory, Allwinner64 CPU, 32GB storage with some micro SD cards coming in the mail late (thanks amazon >:) )

## Status of becoming a daily driver

Right now I do not have everything needed for my daily use yet. When that time comes the pinehone will replace this iPhone 6S Current tasks are as follows:

* ~password manager~ - [compiled qtPass](./postmarketOs/qtpass.md)
* Music
    * m3u reader - I plan on making this myself
    * ~internet radio~ - firefox
* ~Video~ - firefox as well. I tried using kodi for this, and even went as far as 
* ~tox~ [Compiled qTox](./postmarketOs/qtox.md)
* contacts - doing more studying on this. Might create a script that converts vcf to the sqlite3 database gnome-contacts is using.
* ~weather~ - weather.gov & gnome-weather
* ~mail client~ - geary
* totp (one time passcodes) - I already have a script that can be modified to use `zenity`
* ~map~ - gnome-maps. This doesn't meet all conveniences, preferrably I'd like something that could replace apple maps that could read out directions as I'm driving.
* ~calendar~ - using gnome-calendar

## Resources

I use allot of documentation, here is a growing list of places I'm reading

* [Postmarket OS Wiki](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Main_Page)
* [LinuxOnMobile](https://linmob.net)
* [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org)
* [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)

I myself am not a direct source and I probably don't have every answer (just getting into this myself!), so these resources can help you along your path as well :)
